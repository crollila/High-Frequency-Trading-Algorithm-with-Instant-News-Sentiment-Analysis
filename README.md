# ChatGPTTradingBot :star:
This is my AI high frequency trading algorithm, a Node.js project that uses the Alpaca Trade API for trading activities. When a live news event is released via Benzinga News, it will send the important data from the article to a tailored GPT 4.1 model and receive a sentiment analysis score on if the event will have a positive or negative effect on the company stock on a scale from 0-100, 0=worst news, 100=best news, all within 20ms. Based on the score, an algorithm determines if and how much it will BUY/SELL or SHORT/COVER the stock, the algorithm scales based on funds in the account and will adjust if margin trading is wanted. Any quantity of money used up to $10,000,000 will have similar profitable results. Location used has largest impact on success.
